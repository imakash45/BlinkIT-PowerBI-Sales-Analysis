Data Modeling Techniques.

### 🔄 Data Preparation & Cleaning

The following steps were performed using Power Query:-
Removed null and duplicate values, 
Standardized categorical values (e.g., fat content labels), 
Corrected data types, 
Created calculated columns where required, 
Ensured clean relationships between tables, 
This step is critical — skipping it would make the analysis unreliable.
